# Naive Bayes with libraries to be used in different scenarios

Current plans to implement:

* __Binary Naive Bayes Library Options__
  * Overfitting ( Good for samples representing propulation distribution well )
  * Underfitting ( Good for samples representing an unknow population distribution )
  * Fixed Training ( Good for test applications )
  * File-based Training ( Good for modifying training set )
  * API-based Training ( Good for continous training from different sources )
